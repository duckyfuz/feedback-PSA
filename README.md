## Overview

This project focuses on addressing key challenges faced by PSA (Placeholder Company Name) related to employee feedback, culture enhancement, and talent acquisition. The goal is to create a holistic solution that improves employee engagement, fosters a purpose-driven organizational culture, and enhances the hiring process.

## Problem Statement

### Employee Feedback and Engagement
- The HR department plays a pivotal role in ensuring the organization's workforce can adapt, grow, and excel in the face of change.
- Listening to employee feedback is crucial for adaptation and employee retention.
- Failure to adapt may result in employees being replaced.
- How can the organization attract and retain an engaged workforce?

### Feedback Blind Spots
- PSA conducts face-to-face appraisal sessions, but this may not address subtle issues like team dynamics.
- Using polls may create blind spots, as sensitive issues might go unnoticed.
- Some employees may be uncomfortable sharing sensitive concerns.
- How can PSA amplify employee voices and tackle these issues effectively?

### Employee Resilience
- Employees need easier access to information about their competencies.
- Identifying weaknesses provides opportunities for learning and growth.
- How can PSA support employees in identifying and improving their weaknesses?

### Peer Appraisals
- Superior and junior appraisals are time-consuming.
- Technical and soft skill courses may not be effective without knowing specific skill gaps.
- Annual appraisals are infrequent for effective learning.
- Can peer appraisals provide more frequent learning opportunities for employees?

### Feedback Overload
- Collecting employee feedback results in information overload.
- Tracking progress becomes challenging due to numerous improvement suggestions.

### Feedback Consolidation
- PSA aims to consolidate feedback and appraisals to simplify information consumption.
- Highlighting strengths and weaknesses can guide employees toward relevant courses.

### Cultivating Purpose-Driven Culture
- Engaging employees is essential for fostering a purpose-driven organizational culture.
- Identifying tools and strategies to engage employees effectively is crucial.

### Hiring Process
- PSA's hiring process includes technical tests and face-to-face interviews but lacks a cultural fit assessment.
- Technical tests and interviews may not gauge an employee's values or fit with the company culture.
- How can PSA improve its hiring process to ensure cultural fit?

### Utilizing Peer Review Data
- PSA already collects data from peer reviews.
- Can this data be used to define and hire based on the company's culture and values?
- Can peer reviews help identify employees who may be struggling or are a poor culture fit?
